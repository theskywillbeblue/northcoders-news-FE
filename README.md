NC News Now

A functioning news site with articles, comments and a voting system. This reddit-like user interface consumes my NC-News API. Users can view and sort all articles, see those articles filtered by topic, vote on articles, and post or delete comments on individual articles.

The hosted version of this app can be found here: nc-news-now.netlify.app

The hosted back-end API for this app can be found here: https://northcoders-news-app-jog4.onrender.com/api

Getting Started
You can run a local version of this app by doing the following:

Clone this repo locally using the command git clone https://github.com/theskywillbeblue/northcoders-news-FE

Install all dependencies by navigating to the root directory cd northcoders-news-FE and running npm i.
